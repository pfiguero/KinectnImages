First version that works... kind of... ;) 
It is based on DepthBasics-WPF from the Kinect Studio Browser
We want to show several images, and interact with the Kinect

Currently, MainWindow.ProcessDepthFrameData takes the kinect´s depth info and scales it
to the whole screen in the first window... but coordinates are flipped...
