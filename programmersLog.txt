For more comments, see the git logs... ;)
Some future work:
- Add sound effects. I liked this one:

- Do an analysis of the collected data. It is not clear if the fixed std. dev. is ok for detecting if somebody is in front.

First version that works... kind of... ;) 
It is based on DepthBasics-WPF from the Kinect Studio Browser
We want to show several images, and interact with the Kinect

Currently, MainWindow.ProcessDepthFrameData takes the kinect´s depth info and scales it
to the whole screen in the first window... but coordinates are flipped...
